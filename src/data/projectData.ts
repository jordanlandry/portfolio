    description:
      "Developed in React and Typescript, this chess AI is a formidable opponent with its 1600 ELO level play. Utilizing the Minimax algorithm with performance-enhancing optimizations such as alpha-beta-pruning, the AI is capable of making quick and accurate decisions on the chessboard. Additionally, the AI provides an insightful evaluation of each move, indicating whether it's a good move or a blunder, making it a valuable tool for players looking to improve their game.",

      "Built in React and Typescript, this project contains the same features as Netflix, made with user experience as the top priority. Utilizing asynchronous functions for API calls and debounced values for data display, the site ensures a smooth and seamless user experience. Advanced algorithms such as a Levenshtein search, and algorithms that consider the user's watch history to suggest movies based on favourie actors, genres, and directors, make for a personalized viewing experience. The thumbnail of a movie will also dynamically update to feature a frequently watched actor, elevating the overall user experience.",

The language was created as a personal experiment to understand the intracacies of compilers and language design. An online compiler built with Vue.js allows users to write, compile and run JanninScript code, providing the C++ code generated by the compiler as well as the output of the compiled program.",
